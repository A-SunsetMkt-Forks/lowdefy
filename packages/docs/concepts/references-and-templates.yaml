            References are used to split the configuration of an app into logically distinct files, and to reuse configuration in the app. References can be used almost anywhere in the configuration, as long as the configuration remains valid YAML.

            References are made using the [`_ref`](/_ref) operator. If the referenced file has a `.yaml` or `.json` extension, the contents of the file will be parsed, else the file content is included as a string (this is useful for `.md` or `.html` files). As an example of splitting an app into logically distinct files, references can be used to write each page as a separate file:

            ###### lowdefy.yaml
            ```yaml
            lowdefy: LOWDEFY_VERSION

            pages:
              _ref: pages/page1.yaml # Path to the referenced file. Always from the root of the project.
              _ref: pages/page1.yaml
            ```

            The `_ref` operator can take an argument called `vars`. This can be any data, and is passed down to later be accessed with the [`_var`](/_var) operator. By using vars, the referenced file can become a template, using the given variables. For example, a standard page template might be used for multiple pages in an app:

            ###### pages/page1.yaml
            ```yaml
            _ref:
              path: templates/text_page.yaml
              vars:
                id: page1
                title: Page 1
                content: |
                  Page content text.
            ```

            ###### templates/text_page.yaml
            ```yaml
            id:
              _var: id
            type: PageHeaderMenu
            properties:
              title:
                _var: title
            blocks:
              - id: content_card
                type: Card
                blocks:
                  - id: title
                    type: Title
                    properties:
                      content:
                        _var: title
                  - id: content
                    type: Markdown
                    properties:
                      content:
                        _var: content
            ```

            Templating can be taken further by referencing [Nunjucks](https://mozilla.github.io/nunjucks/) template files. If a file ends with the `.njk` file extension, the file will first be hydrated as a Nunjucks template, using the `vars` as template variables. If the file ends with `.yaml.njk` or `.json.njk`, the output of the template will then be parsed. Nunjucks templates are useful since the template file does not need to be valid yaml before it is hydrated, and features like for-loops and if-statements can be used.

            Templating is used extensively to create the Lowdefy docs (these docs are a Lowdefy app). You can look at how they are used [here](https://github.com/lowdefy/lowdefy/tree/main/packages/docs).

            The `_ref` operator can also be extended with custom JavaScript functions. A `resolver` function can be specified, which can overwrite the default way configuration files are read from the filesystem. A `transformer` function can be used to transform the value returned by the `_ref` operator.
