            Lowdefy apps can be deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com). Netlify integrates with git providers to automatically deploy your app when you merge changes into the main branch of your repository and deploy previews of pull requests. On your Netlify deployment you can set environment variables, manage custom domains and more.

            ## How to Deploy to Netlify

            #### Step 1

            Your project will need to be hosted as a Github repository.

            #### Step 2

            Link your Github project to Netlify.

            - Once logged in to Netlify, click the "New site from git" button.
            - Choose Github, and authorize Netlify to access your repositories.
            - Select your repository.

            > If your repository isn't found, click "Configure Netlify on Github", and give Netlify access to your repository.

            #### Step 3

            Configure your Netlify deployment.

            - Set your build command to `npx lowdefy@3 build-netlify`.
            - Set your publish directory to `.lowdefy/publish`.

            #### Step 4

            Configure the Lowdefy server.

            - Click the "Advanced build settings" button.
            - Set the functions directory to `.lowdefy/functions`.

            #### Step 5

            Deploy your site.

            - Click "Deploy site"

            On the "Site overview" tab you will find your site url.

            #### Step 6

            To set Lowdefy secrets, go to "Site settings", then "Build and deploy" in the left menu. Scroll down and select "Edit variables" in the "Environment" section. Here you can set the `LOWDEFY_SECRET_` environment variables.
