      The `S3UploadPhoto` block allows a user to to upload a photo to AWS S3.

      The `s3PostPolicyRequestId` property is required, and should be the `id` of a [`AwsS3PresignedPostPolicy`](/AWSS3) request. This request is called by the block when the user uploads a file, to create a policy that allows a file to be uploaded to AWS S3.

      The block has an object value in state, with a `file` key, which has an object corresponding to the last uploaded file, and a `fileList` array with objects for each the files.
