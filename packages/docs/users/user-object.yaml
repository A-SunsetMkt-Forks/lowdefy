            The `user` object contains all the claims on the OpenID Connect idToken, except for `aud`, `exp`, `iat`, and `iss`.

            The following claims might be included:
            - `sub`: The user id (Subject).
            - `email`
            - `name`
            - `given_name`
            - `family_name`
            - `picture`: A url to the user's profile picture.
            - `updated_at`
            - `email_verified`

            The user object can be accessed using the [`_user`](/_user) operator.

            #### Examples

            ###### Use the user profile picture in a Avatar block:
            ```yaml
            id: avatar
            type: Avatar
            properties:
              src:
                _user: picture
            ````

            ###### Insert user name and id (sub) when inserting a document in MongoDB:
            ```yaml
            id: insert_data
            type: MongoDBInsertOne
            properties:
              doc:
                field:
                  _state: field
                inserted_by:
                  name:
                    _user: name
                  id:
                    _user: sub
            ````
