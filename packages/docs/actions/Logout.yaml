    description: |
      When the `Logout` action is called, the user data and authorization cookie are cleared by the app. The `Logout` action does not take any parameters. The user is then redirected to the URL configured in `logoutRedirectUri`, or the app homepage if this is not configured.

      Some OpenID Connect providers provide a URL that the user can be directed to to logout the user from the the provider. These urls normally have a query parameter that specifies where the provider should redirect the user after they have logged out the user. These redirect URLs are normally configured with the provider.

      See [here](/login-and-logout) for information on how to configure the logout url.
