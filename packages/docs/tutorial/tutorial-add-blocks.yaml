            We would like to add an input form with the following fields:

            - A title for the ticket.
            - The type of ticket. This should be a selection from a list of types.
            - A description of the ticket.

            There should also be submit and reset buttons at the bottom of the page.

            #### Step 3.1 - Add some input blocks

            Copy the following blocks and add them in the card's blocks array.

            ###### `new-ticket.yaml`
            ```yaml
            id: new-ticket
                # ...
            blocks:
              - id: content_card
                # ...
                blocks:
                  - id: page_heading
                    type: Title
                    properties:
                      content: Log a ticket # Change the title on the page.
                      level: 3 # Make the title a little smaller (an html `<h3>`).

                    type: TextInput

                    properties:
                      title: Reset
                      block: true # Make the button fill all the space available to it
                      type: default # Make the button a plain button

            Your booking page should something like this:

            ### What happened

            We added 3 form input blocks to the page. For each of those blocks, we set the `title` property, and for the ticket type selector we set a list of ticket types to the `options` property.

            We also added reset button and submit button. We set a few more properties on the buttons to set their layout and appearance.

            ### How it works

            Lowdefy apps are made from blocks. These blocks can be the page layout with header and menu, a piece of text, a chart or table, tabs or even a popup message or icon. You specify which block is rendered with the `type` field. There are 5 block categories, namely display, input, container, list, and context.

            The first block on a page needs to be a [context](/context-and-state) block. For now, it is enough to understand that this context allows the Lowdefy magic to happen.

            All blocks need to have an `id` that identifies the block. This id should be unique in that block's context.

            ### Up next

            Currently our form doesn't do very much. In the next section we will use [actions](/events-and-actions) and [operators](/operators) to make it more interactive.
