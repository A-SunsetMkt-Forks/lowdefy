            If you have been following along, you can continue with your current config. Else, you can find the config from the previous section [here](/tutorial-add-blocks-config).

            ## Configuring the reset button

            The reset button should reset all the user's inputs. To do this, we can add a reset action to the reset button.

            #### 4.1 - Configure the reset button

            Copy the following into the definition of the reset button:

            ##### `new-ticket.yaml`
            ```yaml
            id: new-ticket
            # ...
            blocks:
              - id: content_card
                # ...
                blocks:
                  - id: page_heading
                    # ...
                    # ...
                    # ...
                  - id: reset_button
                    type: Button
                    layout:
                      span: 12
                    properties:
                      title: Reset
                      block: true
                      type: default
                      icon: AiOutlineClear
            ################ -------- Copy from here -------- ################
                    events:
                      onClick:
                        - id: reset
                          type: Reset
            ################ -------- Copy to here ---------- ################
                  - id: submit_button
                    type: Button
                    # ...
            ```

            If you add some inputs into the form and click the reset button, those inputs should be cleared.

            ### How it works

            Blocks can define events, which they can trigger when certain events happen on the page. You can then define a array of actions, that are executed sequentially when a block triggers an event. The button triggers an event called `onClick` when it gets clicked. We can add an array of action definitions that will be executed when this action is fired. We only added one action, the `Reset` action, that resets the page context to the state it was in when it first loaded.

            ## Required fields

            We should validate the data users are submitting to make sure our app has clean data and works as expected. The `ticket_title` and `ticket_type` fields should be compulsory, and the user should not be able to submit the ticket if they are not completed.

            #### 4.2 - Mark fields as required

            To make the fields required, add a required property to the input blocks like this:

            ```yaml
            - id: ticket_title
              type: TextInput
              required: true
              properties:
                title: Title
            ```

            A red star should appear next to each input field, looking like this:
      - id: example1
        type: TextInput
        required: true
        properties:
          title: Title
      - id: body_validate
        type: MarkdownWithCode
        properties:
          content: |
            We can now add a `Validate` action to the submit button. This will validate the inputs and give an error if any inputs are not filled in.

            #### 4.3 - Add a Validate action

            Add the validate action like this:

            ##### `new-ticket.yaml`
            ```yaml
            id: new-ticket
            # ...
            blocks:
              - id: content_card
                # ...
                blocks:
                  - id: page_heading
                    # ...
                    # ...
                    # ...
                  - id: submit_button
                    type: Button
                    layout:
                      span: 12
                    properties:
                      title: Submit
                      block: true
                      type: primary
                      icon: AiOutlineSave
            ################ -------- Copy from here -------- ################
                    events:
                      onClick:
                        - id: validate
                          type: Validate
            ################ -------- Copy to here ---------- ################
            ```

            Now if we click the submit button and all our inputs aren't complete, a message pops up saying we have validation errors on the page. All the fields that have not been completed are highlighted in red.

            The result should look and work like this. The examples in this tutorial are live versions of the tutorial app, so you can verify that they work like your own app.

            ### How it works

            The validate action we added to the submit button evaluates all the input blocks on the page, and gives an error if any of them fail the validation. This will also stop the execution of any actions after that action. This means we won't insert the data into our database later. The first time a validate action is called on a page it sets a flag that tells all the input blocks to show their validation errors.

            ## Hiding blocks

            We would like to ask the user if they had purchased the product that they are formulating a complaint about, within the last month. To do this we will add a input block with a `visible` property. This property expects a boolean value, so we will use the [`_eq`](/_eq) [`operator`](/operators) to test if the ticket type is equal to `Complaint`

            #### 4.4 - Add a block with a visible condition
            Add the following [`ButtonSelector`](ButtonSelector) to your app.

            ##### `pages/new-ticket.yaml`
            ```yaml
            id: new-ticket
            # ...
            blocks:
              - id: content_card
                # ...
                blocks:
                  # ...
                  - id: ticket_description
                    type: TextArea
                    properties:
                      title: Description
            ################ -------- Copy from here -------- ################
                  - id: purchase_in_last_month
                    type: ButtonSelector
                    visible: # Test if block should be visible to the user
                      _eq: # Equals operator
                        - _state: ticket_type # Get the ticket_type value from state.
                        - Complaint
                    properties:
                      title: Did you purchase this product within the last month?
                      label:
                        colon: false # Hide the label colon
                      options:
                        - Yes
                        - No
            ################ -------- Copy to here ---------- ################
                  - id: reset_button
                    type: Button
            ```

            If you select the "Complaint" ticket type, the selector confirming if you purchased the product within the last month should appear.

            ### How it works

            If the visible field value is `false`, the block won't be rendered. To change this value while our app is running, we use an operator. Operators evaluate every time something in the app changes, like when a user provides an input.

            We used the [`_eq`](/_eq) operator to check the ticket type is 'Bug report'.

            To get the value of the `ticket_type` input, we use the [`_state`](/_state) operator. This get a value from the page's [`state`](/context-and-state). _The `state` is an object where data the app needs is stored_. All inputs automatically write their values to state, and you can also set values in `state` by using the [`SetState`](/SetState) action.

            ## Validation rules

            We would like to add a validation rule on the `purchase_in_last_month` block to warn users that the product that they have purchased may not be eligible for replacement.

            #### 4.5 - Add a validation rule

            Add the following to your app
            ##### `pages/new-ticket.yaml`
            ```yaml
            id: new-ticket
            # ...
            blocks:
              - id: content_card
                # ...
                blocks:
                  # ...
                  - id: purchase_in_last_month
                    type: ButtonSelector
                    visible: # Test if block should be visible to the user
                      _eq: # Equals operator
                        - _state: ticket_type # Get the ticket_type value from state.
                        - Complaint
            ################ ------- Copy from here -------- ################
                    validate:
                      # Show a warning that shows before validate is called
                      # and does not block Validate action.
                      - status: warning
                        message: If you have had the product for over a month, we may not be able to replace it.
                        pass:
                          _eq:
                            - _state: confirm_restart
                            - Yes
            ################ -------- Copy to here ---------- ################
                    properties:
                      title: Did you purchase this product within the last month?
                      label:
                        colon: false # Hide the label colon
                      options:
                        - Yes
                        - No
            ```

            Your app should now show a warning message if `purchase_in_last_month` is not yes.

            ### How it works

            The `validate` field contains an array of validation rules that can be evaluated using operators.

            If the pass field receives `true`, the rule passes and nothing happens. If the rule fails and the status is error, the `Validate` action will fail, like it did for required fields. If the status is warning, a warning will be shown to the user, but the `Validate` action will still pass.

            Your final new ticket page should look and work like this:

      - id: example3
        type: PageHeaderMenu
        properties:
          style:
            minHeight: 300px

        events:
