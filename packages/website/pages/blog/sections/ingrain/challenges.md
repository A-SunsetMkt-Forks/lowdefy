## Ingrain's Challenges
Ingrain is composed of a number of departments, each with its own set of roles and procedures. Because Ingrain serves customers in the food and medical industries, doing an end-to-end investigation when customers experience product problems is paramount.

Orchestrating case investigations across a business with multiple offices and factories has its challenges, all while maintaining a perfect audit history of all actions, comments and supporting documentation.

A general purpose ticketing system may seem like a good solution, but off-the-shelf options cannot serve the department business process solution requirement such as:

- Tracing the issue to the correct source
- Assigning the right people to resolve the complaint
- Tracking the progress in resolving the case
- Documenting each step for reference and auditability
- Updating the client at each step of the process
- Following up with the customer to check if the corrective actions taken resolved the issue
- Generating a PDF print out a summary report for each support case

While some off-the-shelf platforms do allow for a degree of customisation, it would be challenging or even impossible to implement a solution that fits Ingrain's current business processes. Instead the company would need to adapt the fit of the off-the-shelf solution instead, introducing additional cost and change management requirements.

Ingrain needed a bespoke platform built specifically around their needs that integrates into their goal of building a single view of all customer relationships.
