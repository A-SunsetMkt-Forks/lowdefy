## Ingrain

Formerly known as Tongaat Hullett Starch (THS), Ingrain is Africa's largest producer of starch, glucose, and other high-quality ingredients.

Decades of innovation and robust service delivery have made Ingrain a trusted partner to manufacturers of everything from food and beverages to pharmaceuticals and building materials.

Ingrain realised that their complaints process lacked structure to reliably process customer support requirements. More than just a generic ticketing system, they needed to manage support case queries which requires a deeper investigation from multiple departments and roles within Ingrain.
