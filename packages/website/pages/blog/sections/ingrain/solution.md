# Lowdefy's Solution
The Lowdefy Solutions team designed a platform to improve the user experience (UX) for both the customers and the company to facilitate Ingrain's bespoke customer support case management process.

## Simplification
The Lowdefy Solutions team built a customer portal app and team business app with a focus on an easy user experience (UX) for both Ingrain's team and its customers. This allows users to focus only on the tasks and information and required actions that applies to them.

### Logging and Tracking Complaints
In each case, web forms were implemented to ensure user input was both convenient and valid. Standardised categorisation for each case and links to existing customer data. This minimises the risk of input error and improves communication by displaying all relevant information where applicable.

Features like autofill, autocomplete and data lookup dropdowns make it easier for the customers to provide the required information, such as their contact details, product and account information and the nature of their problem.

All platform users have the option to upload files and add any additional information that would be useful for the investigation and resolution process.

### Role Management, Record Keeping and Data Analysis
As part of the resolution process, users of each role are prompted for the specific information they need to provide, ensuring that all procedures are correctly followed and that accurate documentation will be available when required.

Each user action are logged for audit purposes and to provide process transparency to both Ingrain's team and their customers. This data can then be used for reports including trend analysis providing valuable insights into their customers, products and services unlocking opportunities for further optimisation.

## Automation
To assist Ingrain in rolling out an advanced support case resolution and investigation strategy, processes were automated where ever possible to streamline internal workflows.

### Updating the Customer
Once a complaint is logged, the solution generate a unique reference number, and the client would receive an in-app and email notifications on case updates, for example when relevant company representative have been assigned to the case.

Clients always have access their previous complaints, and the system can automatically generate a PDF summary document with a summary of the complaint and its resolution, or even allow the customer to reopen the case if necessary.

### Streamlined Workflows
The steps triggered when the support case is logged allow the actual resolution process to kick-off immediately. With the customer data link to account information, the query can be auto-assign the case to the assigned account representative familiar to the customer, their environment and requirements. The Ingrain representative can then assess the issue to provide feedback, launch a new investigation or even escalate when a high risk problem is identified.

The type of query determines the correct team and workflow path for the investigation to follow, where assigned roles concludes actions directly through the platform to facilitate investigation and Root Cause Analysis (RCA) down to a facility and factory level where required. The forms designed for RCA can be used to automatically create fishbone diagrams and "5-Why Analysis " summaries for a simplified understanding of problem origins within Ingrain.

## Communication
Grouping the right agents for each type of issue greatly improves communication. The Ingrain team can easily discuss each case, and trace the issue back to the origin, or escalate it to management when needed.

### Transparency
By collecting data with each case interaction a full recorded history paints a clear picture to anyone participating or following a support case. Through a series of triggered notifications, all relevant parties are kept up to date on process developments, requirements and documentation. This improves process transparency by making all relevant information accessible to the departments and roles within Ingrain, and to their customers respectively.

### Case Handover
The solution allows the Ingrain team to reassign cases if someone goes on leave or is otherwise unavailable. Training new team members on the intricacies of their support case management processes are also simplified with a easy to use system that facilitates support cases each step of the way.

Case management handover from a customer point of view is also made simple within the Ingrain customer portal. This helps customers with uninterrupted business continuity even when their own staff rotates and responsibilities shift.
